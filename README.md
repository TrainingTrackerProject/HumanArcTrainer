# HumanArcTrainer

This project is made for Human Arc to be able to track the trainings of each of their employees without having to email HR.
The main purposes of this project will be for Human Arc to be able to:
  1. Have its managers be able to view their employee training progresses.
  2. Have HR create and manage trainings.
  3. Have employees be able to view trainings, download training files, and take quizzes.

The solution currently has 2 versions of code in multiple places. In places that are in between comments that say //sean uncomment start
and sean uncomment end are those which use the ADSearcher code. Places that are in between the comments //group uncomment start and
//group uncomment end are places that does not use ADSearcher and instead strictly uses users in the database that were created from 
active directory.

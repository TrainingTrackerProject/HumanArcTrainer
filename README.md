# HumanArcTrainer

This project is made for Human Arc to be able to track the trainings of each of their employees without having to email HR.
The main purposes of this project will be for Human Arc to be able to:
  1. Have its managers be able to view their employee training progresses.
  2. Have HR create and manage trainings.
  3. Have employees be able to view trainings, download training files, and take quizzes.
